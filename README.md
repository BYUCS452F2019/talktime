# talktime
Learn a language by talking with other people, anywhere, anytime.

# Motivation
The fastest way to become conversationally fluent in a foreign language is to speak it with natives.  Many current language   apps in the market can connect you to native speakers, but leave it to you to coordinate across time zones and busy schedules.  Register with Talktime and leave the scheduling to us, while you focus on practicing your language!

### User Interface

We will be creating a simple, functional web application in React.  There will be a login page, dashboard, scheduling page, and if time allows, a simple WebRTC P2P audiovisual feature.

### Database Architectures

We will be using PostgreSQL as a relational database, and further on in the course we will switch to Redis as a NoSQL backend.  We plan to store at the minimum: information about user accounts, known languages, languages being learned, schedule, history, and preferences.
