**Jordan Henstrom -- Option I**

I'm pretty interested in this idea. Funny enough, I was talking about a similar idea with some of my co-workers today in the research lab. I think that this a great idea because of it's ability to connect with the growing interest in learning languages. Additionally, I think that it will provide some good opportunities to learn more about database management.

I think that I would be able to contribute a lot to this project. I have some experience in the relative technologies and would be able to bring that to the group. Additionally, since this is a project I actually care about, I would be able to bring passion to the project.

**Business:**
I think the business of this project really makes sense. Learning languages is really popular these days, and this would provide a way for people to complete the process more readily.

**Legal:**
Considering the information that would be included, privicy is not going to be a major issue. We wont be storing overly sensative data like SSN or bank account information, so we should be able to keep it in the clear

**Technical:**
I think that the technical side of this project will be challenging but doable. I challenge of properly comparing and matching schedules could be an undertaking, but in the end I think that with a dedicated group, we'll be able to get it done promptly. Using elements from Web design, and database management, we'll be able to make a user friendly system that will also perform well.
