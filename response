1. I am interested in language learning and building a social media app. I think the schedule matching part of the app is really cool

2. I have some experience in web programming and I've been working with databases for quite a while, so I think I can pick up the project fairly quick. I am also interested in back-end development as well. I hope that I can contribute to the backend server

3. Business - I think this app has its own market and I think none of the language learning apps out there can do the scheduling intelligently. We can also release premium features which people can pay subscriptions and have access to some advanced features

4. Technical - we are using git, React, PostgreSQL, and NodeJS. Learning a new framework can be challenging.

5. Legal - This app is not accessing any sensitive information besides a log in system and it's a friendly social media app. I don't think we will run into any law issues
