I am fully interested in this project because I know how hard it is to speak a second language. Not having a native speaker to help you when you are learning a new language is hard. I know it because I learned English when I was in Peru, and when I came to BYU, I realized that it should've been better for me to practice with a native speaker. I feel passionate about this project, and this app will also help to find someone whose native language is Italian since I'm starting to learn Italian.

Contribution
I have somewhat experience with web development and databases. Last semester, I took CS 260 which helped me to have experience with front and back end. I feel comfortable using vuejs, Javascript and NodeJS. In addition, I can learn new languages and technologies if you need me to. 

Bussiness
I like how the business idea is connected to databases. I know how to use SQL but if I need to learn a new language for databases, I’ll do it. 

Legal
I really like the idea of only using emails and passwords. Many people don’t like to be asked their date birth or more other information since they are scared the apps can leak their information.

Technical
Even though I have experience with vue, I can learn react to help with the user interface.
