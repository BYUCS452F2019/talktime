# Proposal to Join Talktime

## Interest
As someone who is passionate about language learning, I have a vested interest in this project. I would be willing to work on this app because I know that I would use it. I took an introductory Mandarin course last winter semester before pursuing private lessons during the summer vacation. I agree with Talktime's philosophy that speaking with natives is the best way to learn a language, and I'm excited to work on it so that I can meet new people to help me meet my language goals and also provide an excellent resource for other people to meet theirs.

## Qualifications

I have been working as a web developer for over a year in three different development positions. I worked for BYU doing frontend work for two semesters before doing a summer internship at SimpleNexus as a full stack developer. Most recently I have been working with the BYU history department to create a website to facilitate access to a database of ancient Assyrian records. I am comfortable with modern web technologies including Vue, Ruby on Rails, Python Flask, and Node, among others.

## Comments

### Business

Talktime's business logic requires safe storage of personal data as well as fast lookup times for available speaking times with natives. My familiarity with PostgreSQL will help me to develop queries and schemas that meet these requirements.

### Legal

I appreciate that Talktime doesn't collect sensitive data, and this will help us to stay out of legal trouble.

### Technical

Talktime will feature a simple frontend written in React. Most of my experience is with Vue, but I have some experience with React and the two technologies are similar.
